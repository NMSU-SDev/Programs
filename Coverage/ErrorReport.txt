	RacingScore1.java

FIXING FUNCTIONAL ERRORS FOR VALID INPUTS:

I modified the method overallscore() to set s to the lowest score. Before,  if score1 < score2, then s was set to the bigger score, score2. And if score2 < score1,  then s was set to the bigger score, score1.
 
 
FUNCTIONAL ERRORS FOR INVALID INPUTS: 

Scores should range from 0 to 50 (inclusive), but the program allows values outside of these limits.

	RacingScore3.java:

 FIXING FUNCTIONAL ERRORS FOR VALID INPUTS:

 I modified the method overallScore() to set  s1 and s2  to the two highest scores. Before, the program always set s2 to score2, even when score2 was the lowest score.
 
I changed overallScore() to handle when multiple scores are the same value. Before, if two scores were equal, the program set s1 and s2 to 99. I fixed this error by changing "<" to "<=", and by removing the code that set set s1 and s2 to 99.
 
I removed the condition  "args == null" from the statement "if (args == null  && args.length != 3)" because command line arguments are never null.
