1. I estimate the time needed to complete the assignment will be 3 hours/180 minutes.
2. Breakdown of assignment:
-Thought Design: 100 minutes
-Programming: 60 minutes
-Debugging: 320 minutes
-Total: 480 Minutes
3. The real time to complete the assignment took 480 minutes to complete compared to 
   the initial 180 minute estimate resulting in an accuracy of 266% since it took nearly 3 times
   as long as I initially thought to complete the assignment.
