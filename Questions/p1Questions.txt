1. I estimate the time needed to complete the assignment will be 2 hours/120 minutes.
2. Breakdown of assignment:
-Thought Design: 120 minutes
-Programming: 90 minutes
-Debugging: 30 minutes
-Total: 240 Minutes
3. The real time to complete the assignment took 240 minutes to complete compared to 
   the initial 120 minute estimate resulting in an accuracy of 50% It took twice
   as long as I initially thought to complete the assignment.
