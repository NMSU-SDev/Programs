Question 1:
    I would say that this assignment would take me a total of an hour or two to finish.

Question 2:
    Thought/Design: Half an hour
    Programming: An Hour
    Debugging: Two hours: The majority of debugging happened when creating the Ant file. Other points of debugging can be found in "checking if file exists" portion of code.
               A couple of minutes spent on hello.html to make it "look prettier".
    TOTAL: ~ 3-1/2 hours 
    
Question 3: It was about 57% within my estimation.
