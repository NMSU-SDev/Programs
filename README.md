# Lab 1 (1/24/23)
In this lab, I created a personal GitHub account, forked, and cloned the required repository at link: https://github.com/NMSU-SDev/Programs

After cloning the repository, I created two new projects within the root directory; HelloWorld and Questions. 

Added 'build.xml' files to Circles and SimpleWedServer.
